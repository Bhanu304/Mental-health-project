<p>Mental health illnesses have spiked across the world post COVID and related restrictions. However, though the awareness of mental illness has increased to a large extent compared to the past, it is still a taboo subject in developing countries like India causing most cases to be unreported or unidentified. People with mental health issues ought to have access to reliable and competent health care similar to the care available to people with physical disorders, in order to permanently end the stigma. In a recent report by WHO, it is estimated that one in every eight persons suffers from mental illnesses. It is believed that in India almost 80% of the patients with mental illness do not seek treatment either due to lack of awareness or due to societal pressures or due to non- accessibility of the treatment.Â </p>

Many Indian celebrities like Deepika Padukone, Anushka Sharma and Honey Singh have openly expressed their mental health issues. Further, it is estimated that depression and anxiety are the most common mental disorders in India.&nbsp;</p>
